# Bold Formatter Extension (Name TBD: Boldify / TypeSpark / UniStyle?)

A simple Chrome extension to easily format selected text into **bold** using Unicode characters. Ideal for making text stand out on social media platforms or anywhere else Unicode is supported.

## Features

*   **Context Menu Formatting:** Right-click on selected text in most input fields, text areas, or content-editable elements and choose "Format to Bold" to instantly convert it.
*   **Popup Converter:** Click the extension icon to open a popup. Paste or type text into the input field, and the bold Unicode version will appear below.
*   **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the generated bold text from the popup with a single click.
*   **Multi-language Support:** Available in English (en) and German (de). The extension automatically uses the browser's language setting.
*   **Unicode Characters:** Uses mathematical alphanumeric symbols for bold formatting, ensuring compatibility across many platforms.

## Installation

1.  **Download:** Download the extension files (or clone the repository if available).
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** Open Google Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle, usually found in the top-right corner.
4.  **Load Unpacked:** Click the "Load unpacked" button.
5.  **Select Folder:** Navigate to and select the directory containing the extension's files (including the `manifest.json`).

## Usage

### Context Menu

1.  Select the text you want to format on a webpage (e.g., in a comment box, post editor, etc.).
2.  Right-click on the selected text.
3.  Choose "**Format to Bold**" (or the equivalent in your browser language) from the context menu.
4.  The selected text should be replaced with its bold Unicode equivalent.
    *   *Note:* This works best in standard `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and basic `contenteditable` elements. Compatibility may vary on complex web editors. If direct replacement fails, the bold text is copied to your clipboard as a fallback.

2.  Type or paste the text you want to convert into the top input field.
3.  The bold version will automatically appear in the output area below.
4.  Click the "**Copy**" button to copy the bold text to your clipboard.

## Languages

*   English (Default)
*   German

The extension uses the language set in your Chrome browser.
